<title>Installing</title>

<p>
Installing is the process of taking your built project and copying the files to their specified locations so they can be used correctly.
The <em>install</em> and <em>uninstall</em> <link xref="rules">rules</link> do this for the recipe and its decendants.
The install rule will automatically <link xref="building">build</link> any files that are needed.
</p>
<example>
<p>
If you project contains a single program called <em>foo</em>, then running the following:
</p>
<code>
bake install
</code>
<p>
will take this program and install it to /usr/bin/foo (on Unix systems)
</p>
<code>
bake uninstall
</code>
<p>
will remove the installed files
</p>
</example>
<note>
<p>
You must have sufficient privileges to be able to copy the files to their required locations.
If you need to install the files into a local directory for testing set the <em>root-directory</em> variable when <link xref="config">configuring your project</link>.

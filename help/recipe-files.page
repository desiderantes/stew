<title>Recipe Files</title>

<p>
To describe your project to Bake you need to have a <em>recipe</em> file in the toplevel directory of your project.
This text file is called <em>Recipe</em> (case sensitive) and defines the components of your project using <link xref="variables">variables</link> and <link xref="rules">rules</link>.
</p>

<p>
There are two variables that are required in the toplevel file.
<em>project|name</em> defines the name of the project.
<em>project|version</em> defines the current version of this project.
</p>
<example>
<p>
For example, the <em>foo</em> project (version 0.0.1) has a file called <em>Recipe</em> in the toplevel of the project.
This file contains:
</p>
<code>
project|name = foo
project|version = 0.0.1
</code>
</example>
<p>
To make your project more managable you can have recipe files in the subdirectories under the toplevel recipe file.
When running bake it will automatically look for a recipe file in the current directory, look in find the toplevel recipe and load all the recipes that are decended from it.
Each recipe inherits all the variables from the parent so you can define common values in one recipe and use them in any recipes below this one.
</p>
<example>
<p>
For example, projects are commonly structured to have source files in a <em>src</em> subdirectory and data files in a <em>data</em> subdirectory.
In this case you would have three recipes, one for defining the project, one for defining how the source is compiled and one more for defining the data files:
</p>
<code>
Recipe
data/Recipe
src/Recipe
</code>
</example>
<note>
<p>
You can put comments in your recipes by using the '#' symbol at the start of a line.

<title>Uploading Releases</title>

<p>
Many projects are developed using a remote hosting service.
Bake knows how some of these services work and makes targets in the toplevel recipe to make it releasing easy.
Support services are Launchpad (targets <em>release-launchpad</em>, <em>release-ppa</em>) and GNOME (<em>release-gnome</em>).
</p>
<p>
FIXME: Define special variables
</p>
<example>
<p>
For example, if your <em>foo</em> uses Launchpad for code hosting, go to the top level directory and type:
</p>
<code>
bake release-launchpad
</code>
<p>
This will build a file archive of the current project and upload it to the Launchpad project foo.
</p>
